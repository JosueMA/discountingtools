The discountingtools package is a collection of methods used to perform analyses in delay discounting research.  Among the methods included, this package performs screening of data for systematicity (CITE), applies nonlinear model fitting for a range of conceptual models, and performs a model averaging operation to determine the most probable, true model (CITE).

Discounting Model Candidates

* Noise Model

* Exponential (Samuelson, 1937)

* Hyperbolic (Mazur, 1987)

* Quasi-Hyperbolic - Beta-Delta Exponential (Laibson, 1997)

* Green & Myerson - Two-parameter Hyperboloid (Green & Myerson, 2004)

* Rachlin - Two-parameter Hyperboloid (Rachlin, 2006)

* Ebert & Prelec - Constant-Sensitivity Model (Ebert & Prelec, 2007)

The model averaging operation is performed on all (specified) models candidates to determine a probable, true model and further analyses proceed using the probable model.  A general index of discounting is derived from the most probable, true model for each series.

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.
